                <strong>Lunar Crisis</strong> is an immersive first-person platformer game that inspired by various successful game in the industry such as Neon White and Ghost Runner. This game is also the Project for the Capstone course CSE 5912. Our team work on this game<br>
                <strong>Setting: </strong> A corrupt research organization has kidnapped the (human) player and infused them with moon dust, which is widely believed to grant exceptional powers- which is true. You now move faster and jump further than any human on the planet but you can feel the moon dust shift in your blood with the movements of the moon which causes you immense pain.
                 The facility they've built around you is made to contain a human, but you wouldn't call yourself that anymore. You now plan to escape from the facility, using any experimental tools that you can find, and destroy the moon so you can return to the life which you once had.
            </p>
            <p>
                Built in **Unity** using **C#**, this game focuses on atmospheric storytelling and player exploration. 
                If you're a fan of **3D platformer and runner game**, you'll love this experience!
